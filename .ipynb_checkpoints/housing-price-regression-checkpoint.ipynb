Some are **ordinal**, meaning they are categorical but have a clear order (Example:  Heating Quality (Excellent, Good, Average, Poor)).

This project was connected to a private Kaggle competition.  The Ames data set was divided into a labeled training set, and an unlabeled test set (the labels exist, but are withheld).  I aim to accurately predict the withheld sale prices for the test set, based on the features and prices in the training set.  This exercise mimics real-world modeling scenarios.  \n",

    "- **Nominal variables were one-hot-encoded**, meaning they were converted into a series of binary variables representing whether each category was true for a given house, yes (1) or no (0). \n",
    "- **Ordinal variables were mapped to numerical format.**  At times this can be subjective. If one category is significantly better than the others for example, a simple {0,1,2,3} mapping may not be as appropriate as say, {0,1,2,5}.  In other cases, it may be most accurate to use something like {-2,-1,0,1,2}.  Looking at the counts for each category can be helpful.  In cases where the great majority of houses are in one category, it is often sensible to map this category to 0, and indicate other categories as above or below this \"standard\".  In general, using the data dictionary and then individual research as needed is essential here.\n",
    "- **Null or missing values were addressed**, typically either by removing properties with missing data or imputing values for the missing data.  Some imputations were trivial: Houses with no garage had null values for all garage-related variables, these were imputed easily (Add a 'None' category for 'Garage Type', add 0 for Garage Area, etc.).  Other imputations were more complex:  Many values were missing for Lot Frontage (i.e.; the length in feet over which a property is adjacent to the street). 0 was not a sensible imputation here, the houses must have *some* lot frontage. Imputing the mean lot frontage from all houses was an option, but seemed very rough.  I chose instead to impute the mean lot frontage from the neighborhood in which the house was located.\n",

    "At the end of this process I had a feature table with over 200 variables, and this is prior to any attempts at feature engineering.  I have included images of the variables most highly correlated with sale price, both positively and negatively.  Keep in mind that these may not all be present among the most predictive variables, as some may be highly collinear and cancel out each other's influence.  However we would certainly expect *some* of these top variables to be among our most predictive variables in any final model.  \n",

    "In **supervised machine learning**, we build a model to predict a target variable from a set of feature variables, by training it on individuals where the target variable is already known.  Supervised machine learning problems can be broadly divided into two types of problems:  **classification** problems and **regression** problems.  Classification problems involve trying to predict a categorical target variable - we want to classify new individuals into one of n categories.  Regression problems involve trying to predict a continuous target variable - we want to predict the value of the variable for each new individual.  As sale price is continuous, this is a regression problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regression analysis essentially involves identifying a mapping function that can be applied to a set of feature variable values to generate an estimate of the true target value for a given individual (i.e.; a prediction).  This mapping function is derived by minimizing some **loss function** that indicates the performance accuracy of the mapping function.  The smaller the total loss in our predictions, the closer our predictions are to being correct on average, and the better the performance of the model overall.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic regression technique available to us is **linear regression**.  In this case our mapping function is limited to the form of a straight line:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{eqnarray} y &=& \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_pX_p\\\\ \\end{eqnarray} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, y represents our target prediction for each individual, the different values of X are the values of the feature variables for each individual, and the different values of $ \\beta $ are coefficients that represent the magnitude (positive or negative) of each feature variable's influence on our prediction.  $ \\beta_0 $ represents a constant, the y-intercept of our line; it is also theoretically our prediction for the value of a house where all feature variables = 0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I will use **sklearn's LinearRegression() method** to run my linear regression.  When I run this, sklearn basically identifies the **line of best fit** for the data it receives; that is, the line (in multidimensional space) which minimizes loss between the line and the target values - the line which gives the best predictions overall for the training data.  The standard loss function used in linear regression is **mean squared error**, or the sum of the squares of the error between the predictions (the line) and the actual target values.  This is why we often hear this referred to as least squares regression; the line of best fit is identified by finding the line that minimizes mean squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below depicts a line of best fit for a single feature variable, using the least squares technique.\n",
    "<img src=\"\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time we run LinearRegression(), it will return the best available line of fit from what it receives, plain and simple. This is the first part of minimizing loss.  The second part, and really the part that we have control over, involves **iteratively improving our model by changing the features that we include** when we run LinearRegression().  This can be accomplished by engineering new features to add predictive value, or eliminating redundant and irrelevant features to prevent overfitting.  This may seem simple at first blush, but with hundreds of features and the ability to engineer many more, it can be quite complicated.  I will go into this below.\n",
    "\n",
    "After making such changes and establishing a new line of best fit, we can evaluate the performance of our model by checking the **R2 Score**, which essentially calculates the squared error around our fit line as a percentage of the inherent variance in the data and subtracts that from 1.  The R2 score ranges from 0 to 1, and can be thought of as the percentage of variation in the data that is explained by the predictive power of the model.  The higher the score, the better the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The ultimate goal here is to iteratively minimize the loss in our model's predictions for new data.**  To do this, we want to minimize the loss we observe in our training data, while also preserving generalizability.  These principles extend to even the most complex supervised machine learning problems."

Essentially these were in-family sales where the sale price greatly underestimates the actual value of the home.  The mean squared error for these observations is therefore very large, enough that it significant skews the line of best fit.  \n",

However, leaving them in greatly disrupts loss minimization on the available test subset (that contains no outliers) - in other words, leaving the outliers out allowed you to score much better in the Kaggle rankings.  \n",

    "In my opinion, leaving the outliers in was a flaw in the competition design, because, while instructive about the limitations of loss functions in the presence of outliers, the undersold houses are anomalous cases that take away from the real-world task of trying to accurately assess the price of homes.  I worked around the issue by submitting one model with the outliers and one model without (two submissions were permitted).  For the purposes of demonstrating iterative improvements in model accuracy, I will proceed here with the outliers *excluded*.  You want to do this now, before manipulating the data any further."

I submitted one model with the outliers *excluded*, which allowed me to score accurately on the ranking board (and have a sense of how well my iterative changes were performing on the pure data), and one model with the outliers *included*, because I suspected this would be necessary to perform well in the final evaluation on the whole test set.  \n",

My model without outliers would have ranked in the low 20s at this point (only top scores were ranked).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the actual competition results, evaluated on the entire test set, which included two outliers, my model *with outliers* was my top performing model, and ranked **5th** overall.  Clearly, the influence of the outliers on mean squared error was predominant, but the underlying model appears to have been sound.  I was the only participant ranked in the top 10 on both boards.\n",
